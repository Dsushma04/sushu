        <p>A mental disorder—also called a mental illness or psychiatric condition—is a health condition that affects a person’s thinking, feeling, behavior, or mood in ways that cause significant distress or impair daily functioning.
There are many types of mental disorders, including:
- Mood disorders: like depression and bipolar disorder, which involve persistent sadness or extreme mood swings.
- Anxiety disorders: such as generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and phobias.
- Psychotic disorders: like schizophrenia, which can involve hallucinations or delusions.
- Personality disorders: such as borderline or antisocial personality disorder.
- Neurodevelopmental disorders: including ADHD and autism spectrum disorder.
- Eating disorders: like anorexia nervosa and bulimia.
- Substance use disorders: involving addiction to drugs or alcohol.
These conditions can be caused by a mix of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors, and they often require a combination of treatments like therapy, medication, and lifestyle changes.
If you’re asking out of curiosity or concern—either way, I’m here to help. Would you like to explore a specific type or symptom? Or maybe how to support someone going through it?
